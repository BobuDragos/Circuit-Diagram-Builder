# 🛠️ Circuit Diagram Builder
Welcome to Circuit Diagram Builder, a project developed in C++ as part of my Introduction to Programming Course during my Bachelor's studies.

## 📁 Description
This project allows you to create and visualize electronic circuits using a graphical user interface. You can add different components such as resistors, capacitors, and LEDs, and connect them using wires to create a functioning circuit.

Please note that this project is still in development and does not yet have a simulation feature.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have Code::Blocks installed with the WinBGIm library.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the circuit_diagram_builder.cbp file with Code::Blocks.
3. Build and run the project.
